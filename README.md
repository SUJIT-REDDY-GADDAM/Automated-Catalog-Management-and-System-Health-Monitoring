# Automated-Catalog-Management-and-System-Health-Monitoring

•	Engineered a Python-based solution for automating catalog updates, PDF generation, and email distribution, significantly enhancing operational workflows.
•	Created a system health monitoring script that proactively checks and reports system metrics, ensuring high availability and reliability.
•	Leveraged Python libraries such as ‘smtplib’ for email automation, ‘reportlab’ for PDF creation, and ‘psutil’ for system diagnostics, integrating these tools into a seamless automation process.

# 1. Catalog Updates:
Fetches updates from an API, ensuring the catalog is always current with the latest product information.
Updates the local catalog file by merging in the new data.

# 2. PDF Generation:
Creates a PDF report of the updated catalog using the reportlab library.
This report can be easily shared with stakeholders for review or record-keeping.

# 3. Email Distribution:
Automates the distribution of the PDF report via email using smtplib.
Ensures that all relevant parties receive the latest catalog without manual intervention.

# 4. System Health Monitoring:
Continuously monitors system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage using the psutil library.
Logs these metrics to a file for further analysis, helping to maintain system reliability and availability.


By integrating these functionalities, the script significantly enhances operational workflows, making the catalog management process more efficient and reliable. This use case demonstrates your ability to automate complex tasks using Python and various libraries, showcasing your skills in automation, data processing, and system monitoring.
